Testing 0.1.0

Peltiers = 2x 12706
heat sink = cheap $2 heat sinks

Temperature increase

Plan --> get better heat sink

Testing 0.2.1

peltiers = 2x 12706
heat sink = $30 heat sink
brew-side heat transfer = large CPU water cooling thing

result ==> temperature increase in bucket despite able to form ice crystals on cool side of peliter

assessment ==> ?heat transfer between increasing ambient temp and fermentor greater than between heat exchange block and water

plan ==> remove water block

Testing 0.3.1
run water through system

at 20degrees water, 18 degrees ambient
input temp = 20.0 degrees
output temp = 19.7 degrees
rate = 750 mL/Hr (note temp probes in tubes ==> slower rate)
==> can raise temp of 20L brew by ~0.5-1 degree per hour

Testing 0.3.2
?how low can you go
~300mL water, running through cooling system

results: at ~20 degrees the i/o differential was 0.3
at ~14 degrees i/o differential was ~0.2
